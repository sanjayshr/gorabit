To test the memory usage improvements with iterators, you can follow these steps:
1. Run the Benchmark and Test Cases:
Use the go test command to run the benchmark and test cases.
The memory usage will be logged before and after using the iterators.
Analyze the Logs:
Compare the memory usage logs to see the impact of using iterators.
Running the Tests
1. Ensure MongoDB and RabbitMQ are Running:
Make sure your MongoDB and RabbitMQ services are running. You can use Docker Compose to start them if you have a docker-compose.yml file.
d
Run the Tests:
Use the go test command to run the tests and benchmarks.
go test -v -bench=.
The -v flag enables verbose output, and -bench=. runs all benchmarks.
Example Output
You should see output similar to the following, with memory usage logs before and after using the iterators:
123s
Analyzing the Logs
Memory usage before iterator:
Alloc: The number of bytes allocated and still in use.
TotalAlloc: The total number of bytes allocated, even if freed.
Sys: The total number of bytes obtained from the system.
NumGC: The number of completed garbage collection cycles.
Memory usage after iterator:
Compare the values to see if there is a significant reduction in memory usage.
Example Analysis
If the memory usage after using the iterator is significantly lower than before, it indicates that the iterators are helping to reduce memory consumption.
Additional Tips
Run Multiple Times:
Run the tests multiple times to get an average memory usage, as memory usage can vary between runs.
Profile Memory Usage:
Use Go's built-in memory profiling tools for more detailed analysis. You can enable memory profiling by adding the -memprofile flag to the go test command.
out
Analyze the memory profile using the go tool pprof command.

By following these steps, you can test and analyze the memory usage improvements achieved by using iterators in your Go services.
